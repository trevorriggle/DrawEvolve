# DrawEvolve - Development Session Notes

## Session: 2025-10-07

### Objectives Completed ✅

1. **Paint Bucket Tool Implementation**
   - Added flood fill functionality with color tolerance
   - Implemented CPU-based algorithm (stack-based to prevent overflow)
   - Integrated with undo/redo system
   - Updates layer thumbnails after fill
   - Location: `CanvasRenderer.swift:443-581`, `MetalCanvasView.swift:246-288`

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Moved clear button from bottom corner into main toolbox
   - Fixed layer panel text selection preventing layer switching (TextField → Text)
   - Location: `DrawingCanvasView.swift:137-140`, `LayerPanelView.swift:86-87`

3. **User Flow Restoration**
   - Fixed broken auth → prompt → canvas flow
   - Added `hasCompletedPrompt` flag to track questionnaire completion
   - Implemented proper state transitions between screens
   - Added DEBUG first-launch detection to handle simulator UserDefaults persistence
   - Flow now works: Landing/Auth → Onboarding (first time) → Prompt Input → Canvas
   - Location: `ContentView.swift`

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive feature status document (`FEATURE_STATUS.md`)
   - Documented all working features, partial implementations, and gaps
   - Listed known issues and technical debt
   - Prioritized next steps

### Key Files Modified

- `DrawEvolve/Views/ContentView.swift` - User flow logic and state management
- `DrawEvolve/Views/DrawingCanvasView.swift` - Clear button repositioning
- `DrawEvolve/Views/LayerPanelView.swift` - Fixed text selection bug
- `DrawEvolve/Views/MetalCanvasView.swift` - Paint bucket touch handling
- `DrawEvolve/Services/CanvasRenderer.swift` - Flood fill algorithm implementation
- `FEATURE_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive feature documentation (new)

### Technical Decisions

1. **Flood Fill Algorithm**: Chose CPU-based implementation for now (simpler, works)
   - TODO: Optimize with Metal compute shader for better performance on large fills

2. **UserDefaults Persistence**: Added DEBUG-only first-launch reset
   - Handles simulator's UserDefaults caching between app deletions
   - Only runs in DEBUG builds to avoid affecting production

3. **Layer Text Selection**: Removed TextField editing to fix interaction conflicts
   - Users can no longer rename layers inline (acceptable tradeoff)
   - Could re-add as a separate edit modal if needed

### Known Issues Discovered

1. Simulator UserDefaults persist even after app deletion
2. Paint bucket may be slow on very large fill areas (needs Metal optimization)
3. Export image functionality returns nil (blocks AI feedback feature)

### Next Session Priorities

Based on feature analysis, recommended order:

1. **Export Image Functionality** (HIGH)
   - Implement layer compositing in `CanvasRenderer.compositeLayersToImage()`
   - Unblocks AI feedback feature
   - Enables save/share functionality

2. **Move Tool** (MEDIUM)
   - Basic transform capability
   - High user value

3. **Selection Tools** (MEDIUM)
   - Rectangle select, lasso
   - Enables more advanced editing workflows

4. **Optimize Paint Bucket** (LOW)
   - Convert to Metal compute shader
   - Only needed if performance becomes an issue

### Debug Tips for Future Sessions

- To reset user flow in simulator: Delete app AND reset simulator (`Device > Erase All Content and Settings`)
- Or use the DEBUG first-launch flag (already in place)
- Check Xcode console for flow state prints during debugging
- Paint bucket console logs show pixel fill count

### Outstanding Questions

1. **Auth Backend**: Firebase, Supabase, or custom? Need to decide before implementing real auth
2. **Export Format**: PNG only? PDF support? Resolution options?
3. **Cloud Storage**: Where to store user drawings? S3? Firebase Storage?
4. **Pricing Model**: How does this affect which features to prioritize?
