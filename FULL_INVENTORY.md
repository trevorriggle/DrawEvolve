## ⚠️ Features That Are Broken/Incomplete

### Authentication - SIMPLIFIED TO ANONYMOUS
**Status:** Anonymous UUID-based system (Supabase removed)

**What Exists:**
- ✅ AnonymousUserManager.swift - generates and stores UUID
- ✅ UUID persisted in UserDefaults
- ✅ Clean onboarding flow: Onboarding → Prompts → Canvas
- ✅ No auth screens blocking user journey

**What Was Removed:**
- 🗑️ SupabaseManager.swift (deleted)
- 🗑️ AuthManager.swift (deleted)
- 🗑️ LandingView.swift (deleted)
- 🗑️ SignUpView.swift (deleted)
- 🗑️ SignInView.swift (deleted)

**Future Plans:**
- Can add real auth later (Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects)
- Anonymous users can "claim" their drawings when they sign up
- UUID ready for backend usage tracking

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- ✅ No blocker - simpler is better for testing
- Users can start drawing immediately
- Can add auth in future version based on feedback

### Data Persistence - FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅
**Status:** FileManager-based local storage working!

**What Works:**
- ✅ DrawingStorageManager.swift - complete FileManager implementation
- ✅ Drawings saved to Documents/Drawings directory as JSON files
- ✅ Each drawing includes: imageData, title, feedback, context, timestamps
- ✅ Load drawings on app launch
- ✅ Update existing drawings (when continuing to edit)
- ✅ Delete drawings with file cleanup
- ✅ Drawings persist between app sessions

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No cloud sync (not needed for TestFlight)
- ❌ No compression (images are full-size PNG)
- ❌ No backup/restore functionality

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- ✅ READY FOR TESTFLIGHT
- Users can save and access their work
- Core functionality complete

### Gallery - FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅
**Status:** Working with all core features!

**What Works:**
- ✅ GalleryView.swift with 2-column grid layout
- ✅ Display saved drawings with thumbnails
- ✅ Tap to open DrawingDetailView
- ✅ Delete drawings via context menu
- ✅ Delete confirmation alert
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh to reload drawings
- ✅ Empty state with "Create Drawing" button
- ✅ AI badge for drawings with feedback
- ✅ Sort by date (newest first)
- ✅ Create new drawing from gallery
- ✅ Full-screen canvas for new drawings

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No search/filter
- ❌ No bulk delete
- ❌ No sorting options (only date)
- ❌ No grid size customization

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- ✅ READY FOR TESTFLIGHT
- All essential features working
- Can add advanced features based on feedback

### Onboarding - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** Exists but resets every launch in DEBUG mode

**What Exists:**
- ✅ OnboardingPopup.swift
- ✅ PromptInputView.swift (pre-drawing questionnaire)
- ✅ Flow: Landing → Onboarding → Prompt → Canvas

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ DEBUG mode resets onboarding every launch (line 76-82 in ContentView.swift)
- ❌ Onboarding content might be outdated
- ❌ No skip option
- ❌ Prompt input is required but maybe shouldn't be

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- Low priority
- Can disable for testers
- Nice to have but not critical

### Advanced Tools - DEFINED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** Enum exists, functionality doesn't

**Defined in DrawingTool.swift but NOT working:**
- ❌ Polygon tool
- ❌ Rectangle select
- ❌ Lasso select
- ❌ Magic wand select
- ❌ Smudge tool
- ❌ Blur tool
- ❌ Sharpen tool
- ❌ Clone stamp
- ❌ Move tool
- ❌ Rotate tool
- ❌ Scale tool

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- Low priority
- MVP has enough tools
- Can add later based on feedback

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Issues

### Architecture Issues
1. ✅ **Auth State Management** - FIXED
   - Removed Supabase auth entirely
   - Simple anonymous UUID system
   - Single source of truth in AnonymousUserManager

2. **User ID in Backend Requests**
   - AI feedback requests don't include user ID yet
   - TODO: Pass anonymous UUID to backend for usage tracking
   - Not critical for TestFlight, but needed before monetization

3. **Drawing Context Always Created Fresh**
   - Line 14 in ContentView: `@State private var drawingContext = DrawingContext()`
   - Not persisted, not loaded from previous session
   - User loses their questionnaire answers between launches
   - LOW priority (onboarding reset in DEBUG mode anyway)

### Performance Issues (Potential)
1. **Layer Thumbnail Generation**
   - Regenerates on every frame? (need to verify)
   - Could be optimized with caching

2. **Undo/Redo Stack**
   - Unlimited history could cause memory issues with large drawings
   - Consider max history limit (e.g., 100 actions)

3. **Image Export Size**
   - Base64 encoding large images could be slow
   - Consider compression or resize before upload

### Code Quality Issues
1. **DEBUG Mode Resets**
   - Lines 75-83 in ContentView.swift
   - Resets auth/onboarding every launch
   - Good for testing, but ensure it's disabled for TestFlight build

2. **Scattered TODO Comments** (probably - didn't check all files)
   - Should audit for unfinished work

3. **No Error Logging/Analytics**
   - If something crashes in TestFlight, you won't know why
   - Need crash reporting (Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)

---

## 🚀 TestFlight Requirements

### ✅ Minimum Viable TestFlight Build (What MUST work)

#### P0 - Critical (App Won't Function Without These)
1. **Drawing Works**
   - ✅ Already working - draw with brush, see strokes render
   - ✅ Undo/redo works
   - ✅ Layers work

2. **AI Feedback Works**
   - ✅ Already working - tested with curl this session!
   - ✅ User can draw → tap Get Feedback → see response

3. **App Doesn't Crash on Launch**
   - ⚠️ Need to test on physical device
   - ⚠️ Disable DEBUG reset code (lines 75-83 in ContentView)

4. **Basic Auth or Guest Mode Works**
   - ⚠️ Currently using guest mode as workaround
   - 🔧 Need to test if Supabase auth works at all
   - **Decision needed:** Full auth or just guest mode for TestFlight?

#### P1 - Important (Users Will Notice These Missing)
5. **Drawings Persist Between Sessions**
   - ❌ Currently broken - MUST FIX
   - Users will lose all work if app closes
   - **Implement:** Save to local device (at minimum)
   - **Nice to have:** Cloud sync (can wait)

6. **Gallery to View Past Drawings**
   - ❌ Currently broken - depends on #5
   - Users need to see what they've drawn before
   - **Implement:** Local gallery showing saved drawings
   - Allow opening/editing past drawings

7. **Export Works Reliably**
   - ✅ Works to Photos app
   - 🔧 Test on physical device to confirm

8. **Error Handling for AI Feedback**
   - ⚠️ Partially done - need to test edge cases
   - What if backend is down?
   - What if OpenAI is down?
   - What if network is slow/offline?
   - Show user-friendly errors

#### P2 - Nice to Have (Can Launch Without)
9. **Onboarding Flow**
   - ⚠️ Exists but not polished
   - Can skip for TestFlight (testers will figure it out)

10. **Brush Settings Polish**
    - ⚠️ Works but could be prettier
    - Not critical for testing

11. **UI Polish**
    - ⚠️ Functional but not beautiful
    - Can improve based on feedback

---

## 🎨 UX Improvements Needed

### Critical UX Issues (Users Will Struggle)

1. **No Visual Feedback When AI is Thinking**
   - User taps "Get Feedback" → nothing happens for 5-10 seconds
   - Need loading spinner/animation
   - Show progress: "Analyzing your drawing..."

2. **Feedback Overlay UX**
   - How do users dismiss it? (need to verify)
   - Can they copy the feedback text?
   - Can they save it for later?
   - Should show feedback alongside drawing (split screen?)

3. **First-Time User Confusion**
   - What do I do first?
   - Where are the drawing tools?
   - How do I get feedback?
   - Need better onboarding or tutorial hints

4. **No Confirmation on Destructive Actions**
   - Delete layer - are you sure?
   - Clear canvas - are you sure?
   - Close app with unsaved work - are you sure?

5. **Color Picker is Hidden**
   - How do users know it exists?
   - Need visible color indicator in toolbar

### Important UX Issues (Annoying But Not Blocking)

6. **Toolbar Auto-Collapse Timing**
   - Does it collapse too fast? Too slow?
   - Need to test and tune

7. **Layer Panel Takes Up Screen Space**
   - Could it be collapsible like toolbar?
   - Or smaller thumbnails?

8. **Brush Size Preview**
   - Hard to know what size you're drawing at
   - Show cursor size preview?

9. **Undo/Redo Buttons Not Obvious**
   - Where are they? (need to verify in UI)
   - Should be prominent

10. **No Drawing Title/Name**
    - All drawings are unnamed
    - Hard to find specific drawing later in gallery

### Nice to Have UX Improvements

11. **Gesture Controls**
    - Two-finger tap to undo?
    - Pinch to zoom canvas?
    - Pan to move around large canvas?

12. **Quick Color Swatches**
    - Recently used colors
    - Favorite colors
    - Common color palettes

13. **Brush Presets**
    - Save favorite brush settings
    - Quick switch between presets

14. **Progress Indicators**
    - "You've drawn for 15 minutes today!"
    - "This is your 5th drawing!"
    - Gamification elements
