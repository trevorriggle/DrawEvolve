## ⚠️ Features That Are Broken/Incomplete

### Authentication - PARTIALLY BROKEN
**Status:** Supabase integration started but not fully functional

**What Exists:**
- ✅ SupabaseManager.swift (client initialized)
- ✅ AuthManager.swift (sign up, sign in, sign out methods)
- ✅ LandingView.swift (auth UI)
- ✅ SignUpView.swift
- ✅ SignInView.swift
- ✅ "Continue as Guest" mode

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ Auth flow doesn't actually work reliably
- ❌ Session persistence questionable
- ❌ No user ID passed to backend (needed for usage tracking)
- ❌ Guest mode bypasses auth entirely (security risk)
- ❌ No password reset flow
- ❌ No OAuth (Apple Sign In, Google, etc.)

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- Medium priority for TestFlight
- Can use "guest mode" for initial testing
- MUST FIX before any real user data or monetization

### Data Persistence - INCOMPLETE
**Status:** Drawings are NOT saved

**What Exists:**
- ✅ DrawingStorageManager.swift file exists
- ✅ Basic save/load structure

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ Drawings don't persist between app sessions
- ❌ No cloud sync
- ❌ No gallery of past drawings
- ❌ Export works, but only to Photos app (one-time)

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- HIGH priority for TestFlight
- Users will lose work if app closes
- Gallery feature can't work without this

### Gallery - NON-FUNCTIONAL
**Status:** UI exists but no data to show

**What Exists:**
- ✅ GalleryView.swift file
- ✅ Basic layout

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ No saved drawings to display
- ❌ Can't open/edit past drawings
- ❌ No delete functionality
- ❌ No search/filter

**Impact on TestFlight:**

- Not essential for initial testing
- Depends on fixing data persistence first

### Onboarding - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** Exists but resets every launch in DEBUG mode

**What Exists:**
- ✅ OnboardingPopup.swift
- ✅ PromptInputView.swift (pre-drawing questionnaire)
- ✅ Flow: Landing → Onboarding → Prompt → Canvas

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ DEBUG mode resets onboarding every launch (line 76-82 in ContentView.swift)
- ❌ Onboarding content might be outdated
- ❌ No skip option
- ❌ Prompt input is required but maybe shouldn't be

**Impact on TestFlight:**
- Low priority

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Issues

### Security Issues
1. **Supabase API Key Exposed in Code** (SupabaseManager.swift:20)
   - Hardcoded in source code (bad practice)
   - Should be in Config.plist or environment variable
   - Low risk (it's the anon key, has RLS) but still poor practice

2. **Guest Mode Bypasses Auth**
   - Sets `isAuthenticated = true` without actual authentication
   - Could lead to weird states
   - Need proper guest user handling

### Architecture Issues
1. **Auth State Management Confusion**
   - `@AppStorage("isAuthenticated")` in ContentView
   - `@Published var isAuthenticated` in AuthManager
   - Two sources of truth = bugs waiting to happen

2. **No User ID in Backend Requests**
   - AI feedback requests don't include user ID
   - Can't track usage per user
   - Can't implement rate limiting or premium features
   - MUST FIX before monetization

3. **Drawing Context Always Created Fresh**
   - Line 15 in ContentView: `@State private var drawingContext = DrawingContext()`
   - Not persisted, not loaded from previous session
   - User loses their questionnaire answers

### Performance Issues (Potential)
1. **Layer Thumbnail Generation**
   - Regenerates on every frame? (need to verify)
   - Could be optimized with caching

2. **Undo/Redo Stack**
   - Unlimited history could cause memory issues with large drawings
   - Consider max history limit (e.g., 100 actions)

3. **Image Export Size**
   - Base64 encoding large images could be slow
   - Consider compression or resize before upload

### Code Quality Issues
1. **DEBUG Mode Resets**
   - Lines 75-83 in ContentView.swift
   - Resets auth/onboarding every launch
   - Good for testing, but ensure it's disabled for TestFlight build

2. **Scattered TODO Comments** (probably - didn't check all files)
   - Should audit for unfinished work

3. **No Error Logging/Analytics**
   - If something crashes in TestFlight, you won't know why
   - Need crash reporting (Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)

## 🚀 TestFlight Requirements

### ✅ Minimum Viable TestFlight Build (What MUST work)

#### P0 - Critical (App Won't Function Without These)
1. **Drawing Works**
   - ✅ Already working - draw with brush, see strokes render
   - ✅ Undo/redo works
   - ✅ Layers work

2. **AI Feedback Works**
   - ✅ Already working - tested with curl this session!
   - ✅ User can draw → tap Get Feedback → see response

3. **App Doesn't Crash on Launch**
   - ⚠️ Need to test on physical device
   - ⚠️ Disable DEBUG reset code (lines 75-83 in ContentView)

4. **Basic Auth or Guest Mode Works**
   - ⚠️ Currently using guest mode as workaround
   - 🔧 Need to test if Supabase auth works at all
   - **Decision needed:** Full auth or just guest mode for TestFlight?

#### P1 - Important (Users Will Notice These Missing)
5. **Drawings Persist Between Sessions**
   - ❌ Currently broken - MUST FIX
   - Users will lose all work if app closes
   - **Implement:** Save to local device (at minimum)
   - **Nice to have:** Cloud sync (can wait)

6. **Gallery to View Past Drawings**
   - ❌ Currently broken - depends on #5
   - Users need to see what they've drawn before
   - **Implement:** Local gallery showing saved drawings
   - Allow opening/editing past drawings

7. **Export Works Reliably**
   - ✅ Works to Photos app
   - 🔧 Test on physical device to confirm

8. **Error Handling for AI Feedback**
   - ⚠️ Partially done - need to test edge cases
   - What if backend is down?
   - What if OpenAI is down?
   - What if network is slow/offline?
   - Show user-friendly errors

#### P2 - Nice to Have (Can Launch Without)
9. **Onboarding Flow**
   - ⚠️ Exists but not polished
   - Can skip for TestFlight (testers will figure it out)

10. **Brush Settings Polish**
    - ⚠️ Works but could be prettier
    - Not critical for testing

11. **UI Polish**
    - ⚠️ Functional but not beautiful
    - Can improve based on feedback

---

## 🎨 UX Improvements Needed

### Critical UX Issues (Users Will Struggle)

1. **No Visual Feedback When AI is Thinking**
   - User taps "Get Feedback" → nothing happens for 5-10 seconds
   - Need loading spinner/animation
   - Show progress: "Analyzing your drawing..."

2. **Feedback Overlay UX**
   - How do users dismiss it? (need to verify)
   - Can they copy the feedback text?
   - Can they save it for later?
   - Should show feedback alongside drawing (split screen?)

3. **First-Time User Confusion**
   - What do I do first?
   - Where are the drawing tools?
   - How do I get feedback?
   - Need better onboarding or tutorial hints

4. **No Confirmation on Destructive Actions**
   - Delete layer - are you sure?
   - Clear canvas - are you sure?
   - Close app with unsaved work - are you sure?

5. **Color Picker is Hidden**
   - How do users know it exists?
   - Need visible color indicator in toolbar

### Important UX Issues (Annoying But Not Blocking)

6. **Toolbar Auto-Collapse Timing**
   - Does it collapse too fast? Too slow?
   - Need to test and tune

7. **Layer Panel Takes Up Screen Space**
   - Could it be collapsible like toolbar?
   - Or smaller thumbnails?

8. **Brush Size Preview**
   - Hard to know what size you're drawing at
   - Show cursor size preview?

9. **Undo/Redo Buttons Not Obvious**
   - Where are they? (need to verify in UI)
   - Should be prominent

10. **No Drawing Title/Name**
    - All drawings are unnamed
    - Hard to find specific drawing later in gallery

### Nice to Have UX Improvements

11. **Gesture Controls**
    - Two-finger tap to undo?
    - Pinch to zoom canvas?
    - Pan to move around large canvas?

12. **Quick Color Swatches**
    - Recently used colors
    - Favorite colors
    - Common color palettes

13. **Brush Presets**
    - Save favorite brush settings
    - Quick switch between presets

14. **Progress Indicators**
    - "You've drawn for 15 minutes today!"
    - "This is your 5th drawing!"
    - Gamification elements
