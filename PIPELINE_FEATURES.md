## ðŸ“Š Phase 1: Progress Tracking & Evolution (The Snapshot System)

**Goal:** Make users addicted to seeing their own improvement

### Features
- [ ] **Drawing Snapshots**
  - Capture drawing + AI feedback + user context at point in time
  - Store metadata: date, time spent, tools used, layers used
  - Link to previous iterations if user is redrawing same subject

- [ ] **Progress Timeline**
  - Visual timeline showing all drawings chronologically
  - Filter by subject, style, technique
  - "Before/After" comparison views
  - Highlight improvement metrics (AI detects quality improvements)

- [ ] **Evolution Analytics**
  - AI-generated progress summaries: "Your line work has improved 40% since last month"
  - Identify patterns: "You draw more when feedback is positive"
  - Skill radar chart: composition, color theory, anatomy, perspective, etc.
  - Weekly/monthly progress reports

- [ ] **Smart Context Resumption**
  - AI remembers your previous drawings and feedback
  - "Last time you struggled with proportions, let's check if you improved"
  - Personalized challenges based on past work
  - Token optimization: summarize old context instead of full history

### Technical Requirements
- Snapshot data model (drawing image, feedback text, metadata, user context)
- Local storage + cloud sync
- Analytics engine to detect improvement patterns
- AI summarization for long-term memory

**Why This Matters:** Retention. Once someone has 20+ snapshots, they're emotionally invested in their journey.

## ðŸ¤– Phase 2: Custom AI Art Teachers (Agents)

**Goal:** Personalization + social sharing + viral growth

### Features
- [ ] **Agent Customization**
  - Create custom AI mentors with unique personalities
  - Choose teaching style: harsh critic, encouraging supporter, technical expert, etc.
  - Select expertise: portraiture, landscapes, abstract, comic art, realism
  - Customize feedback format: bullet points, essays, quick tips
  - Give them names and avatars

- [ ] **Agent Personas (Examples)**
  - "Picasso" - encourages breaking rules, abstract thinking
  - "Bob Ross" - ultra-encouraging, focuses on joy of painting
  - "Da Vinci" - technical precision, anatomy, engineering approach
  - "Miyazaki" - storytelling through art, emotional resonance
  - User-created custom agents

- [ ] **Agent Library**
  - Browse community-created agents
  - Try agents before adopting them
  - Rate agents (which ones give best feedback?)
  - Share your agent with friends
  - **Monetization idea:** Premium agents, user-created paid agents

- [ ] **Multi-Agent Feedback**
  - Get feedback from multiple agents on same drawing
  - Compare different perspectives
  - "Your Picasso agent loved it, but your Da Vinci agent wants better anatomy"

### Technical Requirements
- Prompt engineering system for agent personalities
- Agent data model (name, avatar, personality params, expertise areas)
- Agent sharing/discovery system
- Multi-agent orchestration (parallel API calls with different prompts)

**Why This Matters:** Ownership + creativity + shareability. "Check out my custom agent!" is marketing gold.

## ðŸ’­ Open Questions

1. **Pricing:** What's the right price point for premium? ($4.99? $9.99? $14.99?)
2. **Platform:** iOS first, or expand to iPad/Mac/Android soon?
3. **Target Market:** Hobbyists? Students? Professionals? All three?
4. **Competitive Moat:** What's the ONE thing we do better than everyone else?
5. **Viral Loop:** What's the single best growth lever? (Referrals? Agent sharing? Gallery?)
6. **AI Costs:** How do we keep OpenAI API costs sustainable at scale?

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Works

**You built an MVP in 8 hours.** That's the proof.

- âœ… You ask the right questions (Metal vs. PencilKit saved weeks)
- âœ… You think in systems (Lynk snapshot â†’ DrawEvolve evolution)
- âœ… You focus on the core loop (draw â†’ feedback â†’ improve)
- âœ… You're not afraid to pivot (Vercel â†’ Cloudflare in one session)

**The path forward is clear:**
1. Polish what exists
2. Add snapshots/progress tracking (retention)
3. Add custom agents (personalization)
4. Add social features (virality)
5. Monetize (sustainability)

**This isn't just an app. It's a creative practice platform with a moat.**

Let's build it.
