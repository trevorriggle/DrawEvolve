# DrawEvolve - Pipeline Features & Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-06
**Status:** MVP+ Complete with Known Issues

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues (November 2025)

### Critical
1. **Canvas Rotation Stretching** - Rotating the canvas causes drawings to stretch and distort. Proportions are not maintained during rotation, causing circles to become ellipses and squares to become rectangles. See `ROTATION_STRETCHING_FIX_PLAN.md` for detailed analysis and fix plan.

### Deferred Features
2. **Unimplemented Tools** - 8 tools remain unimplemented (Smudge, Clone Stamp, Move). See `TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` and `toolaudit.md` for details.
3. **Blur/Sharpen Brush Mode** - Currently apply globally to entire layer instead of brush-based application.

## 🤖 Phase 7: Portfolio Analysis Pipeline (Agentic System)

**Goal:** Transform DrawEvolve from reactive feedback tool into proactive long-term mentor

### Core Concept
An autonomous AI system that reviews an artist's portfolio over time, tracks progress, detects patterns, and evolves coaching strategy based on longitudinal data.

### Architecture: Plan → Act → Reflect → Update Loop

**1. Plan Phase (Orchestrator)**
- Define sub-tasks based on available data
- Determine analysis scope (new drawings vs full portfolio)
- Schedule parallel vs sequential operations
- Set quality thresholds and uncertainty flags

**2. Act Phase (Specialized Agents)**
- **Fetch Agent:** Retrieve recent drawings + metadata
- **Compare Agent:** Analyze changes vs last snapshot
- **Style Agent:** Track visual style evolution via embeddings
- **Critique Agent:** Generate personalized feedback referencing past work
- **Metrics Agent:** Calculate quantitative improvement scores

**3. Reflect Phase (Quality Control)**
- Cross-check agent outputs for consistency
- Flag contradictions or insufficient data
- Verify statistical significance of detected trends
- Surface uncertainty to user when appropriate

**4. Update Phase (Persistence)**
- Write new portfolio snapshot to database
- Update user's "artistic profile" (strengths, weaknesses, goals)
- Generate summary for UI display
- Prepare personalized challenges for next session

### Technical Implementation

**Data Model:**
```sql
-- Portfolio snapshots (periodic artist profile)
CREATE TABLE portfolio_snapshots (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,

  -- Quantitative metrics
  metrics JSONB, -- {anatomy: 7.2, composition: 8.1, color_theory: 6.5, ...}

  -- Qualitative insights
  strengths TEXT[], -- ["improving line confidence", "developing unique style"]
  weaknesses TEXT[], -- ["inconsistent proportions", "limited color palette"]

  -- Progress indicators
  improvement_areas JSONB, -- {anatomy: +1.2, perspective: -0.3, ...}

  -- Summary for display
  summary_text TEXT,

  -- Reference to drawings analyzed
  drawing_ids UUID[]
);

-- Critique history (per-drawing feedback)
CREATE TABLE critique_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  drawing_id UUID REFERENCES drawings(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,

  critique_text TEXT,
  focus_areas TEXT[], -- ["anatomy", "composition"]
  ai_model TEXT, -- "gpt-4o-vision"

  -- Link to portfolio snapshot
  snapshot_id UUID REFERENCES portfolio_snapshots(id)
);

-- Drawing embeddings (for style tracking)
CREATE TABLE drawing_embeddings (
  drawing_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES drawings(id),
  embedding VECTOR(512), -- CLIP or similar
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Agent Prompt Templates:**

*Orchestrator Agent:*
```
You are the Portfolio Analysis Orchestrator. Your job is to coordinate
specialized agents to analyze user {user_id}'s artistic progress.

Available data:
- {num_new_drawings} new drawings since last snapshot
- Last snapshot date: {last_snapshot_date}
- User goals: {user_goals}

Plan the analysis workflow:
1. What sub-tasks are needed?
2. Which agents should run in parallel?
3. What's the minimum data threshold for valid analysis?
4. Should we flag uncertainty if data is insufficient?

Output your plan as JSON.
```

*Compare Agent:*
```
You are the Progress Comparison Agent. Analyze artistic improvement
over time by comparing current work to past snapshots.

Current drawings: {current_drawings}
Last snapshot metrics: {last_snapshot_metrics}
Previous feedback themes: {past_critiques_summary}

For each metric (anatomy, composition, color, etc.):
- Has it improved? By how much?
- What specific changes demonstrate this?
- Are improvements consistent or one-off flukes?

Be statistically honest - say "insufficient data" if sample size is too small.
```

*Reflection Agent:*
```
You are the Quality Control Agent. Review outputs from other agents
and check for consistency, contradictions, and uncertainty.

Inputs:
- Compare Agent: {compare_output}
- Style Agent: {style_output}
- Critique Agent: {critique_output}

Questions to answer:
1. Do all agents agree on key findings?
2. Are there contradictions that need resolution?
3. Is there enough data to support conclusions?
4. Should we flag uncertainty to the user?

Output: APPROVE | REVISE | INSUFFICIENT_DATA
```

### Scheduling & Triggers

**Periodic Analysis:**
- Weekly snapshots for active users (5+ drawings/week)
- Monthly deep dives for all users
- On-demand via "Analyze My Progress" button

**Compute Optimization:**
- Incremental analysis (only new drawings) for weekly runs
- Full portfolio re-analysis monthly or when user requests
- Cache embeddings to avoid re-computing
- Batch processing during off-peak hours

**Cost Management:**
- Use smaller model (GPT-4o-mini) for routine comparisons
- Use GPT-4o only for complex critique generation
- Store summaries, not full context, for long-term memory
- Token optimization: summarize old snapshots instead of full history

**Personalized Coaching:**
- "Last time you struggled with foreshortening. Let's see if you've improved!"
- "Your color harmony has plateaued - ready for a new challenge?"
- "You draw more when feedback is positive - here's extra encouragement!"

### MVP Implementation Path

**Phase 1: Basic Snapshots (Week 1)**
- Add `portfolio_snapshots` table
- Simple weekly job: fetch last 10 drawings, generate summary
- Store as JSON blob (no fancy agents yet)
- UI: "Last Snapshot" view showing progress summary

**Phase 2: Comparison Logic (Week 2)**
- Build "before/after" comparison for specific metrics
- Detect improvement: "Line quality +2 points since last month"
- Store structured metrics (not just text)

**Phase 3: Agentic Orchestrator (Week 3-4)**
- Implement Plan → Act → Reflect → Update loop
- Use LangChain or similar framework
- Deploy reflection layer for quality control
- Test with beta users

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (Ongoing)**
- Style embeddings for visual tracking
- Multi-agent consensus (3 agents vote on critique)
- Personalized learning paths based on trends
- UI visualization (charts, timelines, progress graphs)

### Why This Is a Moat

**Defensibility:**
- Proprietary data: Your users' progress over time
- Network effects: More data = better insights
- Hard to replicate: Requires longitudinal tracking, not just point-in-time feedback

**Retention:**
- Emotional investment: "I have 6 months of progress here!"
- Sunk cost: Users won't want to lose their history
- Gamification: Seeing improvement is addictive

**Differentiation:**
- Competitors offer one-shot feedback
- DrawEvolve offers ongoing mentorship
- "Duolingo for art" - tracks your learning journey

### Open Challenges

**Cold Start:**
- What to show new users with <5 drawings?
- Solution: Focus on snapshot critique until enough data for trends

**Privacy:**
- Some users may not want "AI stalking my progress"
- Solution: Opt-in system, user can delete snapshots

**Accuracy:**
- AI might hallucinate trends from noise
- Solution: Require statistical significance, surface uncertainty

**Compute Cost:**
- Running embeddings + LLMs on entire portfolio = expensive
- Solution: Incremental analysis + monthly deep dives
