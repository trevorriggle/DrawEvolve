# Where We Left Off

## Status: Metal Canvas Foundation Complete, Shaders Needed

### What's Done ✅
- **Completely removed PencilKit** - was too limited (Notes app tech)
- **Built Metal-based drawing engine foundation**:
  - Layer system with blend modes (Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Add)
  - Tool system (Brush, Eraser, Paint Bucket, Eyedropper)
  - Pressure-sensitive brush engine with Apple Pencil support
  - Advanced color picker with HSB sliders
  - Layer management UI (add, delete, opacity, visibility, lock)
  - Brush settings panel (size, opacity, hardness, spacing, pressure curves)
  - Undo/redo history system (50 actions)
  - Side toolbar with all tools
  - Touch handling and stroke interpolation

### What's Missing ⚠️
**Metal Shaders Not Written Yet** - Canvas won't actually draw until we add:

1. **Metal shader file** (`Shaders.metal`):
   - Vertex shader for brush stroke positioning
   - Fragment shader for pixel coloring with pressure/opacity/hardness
   - Blend mode shaders for layer compositing
   - Compute shader for paint bucket flood fill

2. **Wire up shaders to CanvasRenderer.swift**:
   - Load vertex/fragment functions
   - Complete `renderStroke()` implementation
   - Finish `compositeLayersToImage()` for feedback
   - Implement `floodFill()` for paint bucket

3. **Connect touch handling in MetalCanvasView**:
   - Currently stubs exist but rendering not hooked up
   - Need to call renderer methods from Coordinator

### Current Build Status
- ✅ Builds without errors
- ✅ UI shows up (landing, onboarding, questionnaire, canvas)
- ✅ Tools, layers, colors all have UI
- ❌ Canvas is blank white - touching it does nothing (no shaders)

### Next Steps
1. Write `Shaders.metal` file (~200-300 lines of Metal shading language)
2. Update `CanvasRenderer.swift` to load and use shaders
3. Connect rendering in `MetalCanvasView.Coordinator`
4. Test drawing with Apple Pencil
5. Verify layer compositing works
6. Implement paint bucket flood fill

### Estimated Work Remaining
- **Metal shaders**: 5-10k tokens
- **Testing & debugging**: 2-5k tokens
- **Total**: Should finish in current conversation (74k tokens left)

### Files Changed in Last Session
**New Files (8):**
- `DrawingLayer.swift` - Layer model
- `DrawingTool.swift` - Tool definitions
- `CanvasRenderer.swift` - Metal rendering engine (incomplete)
- `HistoryManager.swift` - Undo/redo
- `MetalCanvasView.swift` - Metal canvas view (incomplete rendering)
- `ColorPicker.swift` - HSB color picker
- `LayerPanelView.swift` - Layer management UI
- `BrushSettingsView.swift` - Brush settings UI

**Modified:**
- `DrawingCanvasView.swift` - Completely rewritten for Metal
- `DrawEvolve.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Added all new files

### User Preference Notes
- Wants professional drawing app, not toy
- **Layers are THE most critical feature**
- Hates PencilKit for lacking basic features (paint bucket, etc.)
- Running on headless Mac Mini via VS Code remote
- Building/testing in Xcode on Mac, coding in Codespaces

### Resume Point
User said "heading to lunch, Codespace will reset" - when they return:
1. Confirm build still works
2. Ask if they want Metal shaders written now
3. Finish the rendering engine
4. Get drawing actually working
