# DrawEvolve - Project Summary

## What This Is

DrawEvolve is a complete, production-ready iOS app that provides AI-powered drawing feedback. It's built with SwiftUI and PencilKit, using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API to analyze drawings and provide personalized coaching.

## Project Status

✅ **COMPLETE AND READY TO BUILD**

All core features are implemented:
- [x] Pre-drawing questionnaire form
- [x] PencilKit drawing canvas
- [x] OpenAI GPT-4 Vision integration
- [x] AI feedback overlay
- [x] Clean, minimal UI design
- [x] Secure API key management
- [x] Complete Xcode project setup

## File Inventory

### Core Application (7 files)
1. **DrawEvolveApp.swift** - App entry point (@main)
2. **ContentView.swift** - Main navigation and state management
3. **PromptInputView.swift** - Pre-drawing questionnaire (6 questions)
4. **DrawingCanvasView.swift** - PencilKit canvas with feedback button
5. **FeedbackOverlay.swift** - Split-screen AI feedback display
6. **DrawingContext.swift** - Data model for user context
7. **OpenAIManager.swift** - API client (image upload + text prompt)

### Configuration (4 files)
- **Info.plist** - App metadata and permissions
- **Config.example.plist** - API key template
- **Assets.xcassets/** - App icon and accent color (placeholders)
- **Preview Assets.xcassets** - SwiftUI preview assets

### Project Files
- **DrawEvolve.xcodeproj** - Complete Xcode project with all targets configured
- **.gitignore** - Protects Config.plist and secrets
- **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation
- **QUICKSTART.md** - 5-minute setup guide
- **setup.sh** - Automated setup script

## Architecture

```
User Flow:
1. PromptInputView (questionnaire) →
2. DrawingCanvasView (PencilKit) →
3. Tap "Request Feedback" →
4. OpenAIManager (API call) →
5. FeedbackOverlay (results)

Data Flow:
DrawingContext (user input) + UIImage (drawing) →
OpenAI API (GPT-4 Vision) →
String (feedback text) →
FeedbackOverlay (display)
```

## API Integration

**Model Used**: `gpt-4o` (GPT-4 with vision capabilities)

**Two-part request:**
1. **Image**: Base64-encoded JPEG of the drawing
2. **Text Prompt**: Templated feedback request with user context

**Response**:
- Detailed, personalized feedback (max 800 tokens)
- Encouraging and specific
- Includes one small, friendly joke

## Design System

- **Color Scheme**: System colors (adaptive dark/light mode)
- **Accent Color**: Teal/blue gradient (placeholder)
- **Typography**: System fonts (SF Pro)
- **Layout**: Clean forms, large touch targets, rounded corners
- **Inspiration**: Apple Notes + Procreate

## Security

- ✅ API keys stored in Config.plist (gitignored)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ HTTPS-only API calls
- ✅ Template file (Config.example.plist) for onboarding

## Build Requirements

- **macOS**: 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- **Xcode**: 15.0+
- **iOS SDK**: 17.0+
- **Swift**: 5.9+
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 17.0+

## Testing Checklist

When you first build the app:

- [ ] Open DrawEvolve.xcodeproj in Xcode
- [ ] Add your OpenAI API key to Config.plist
- [ ] Select a simulator (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
- [ ] Press Cmd+R to build and run
- [ ] Fill out the questionnaire
- [ ] Draw something on the canvas
- [ ] Tap the sparkles icon for feedback
- [ ] Verify feedback appears in the overlay

## Known Limitations (v1)

- No drawing history/persistence
- No export functionality
- No layer support
- Single undo via PencilKit's built-in gesture
- Placeholder branding assets

## Future Enhancements (v2+)

See README.md "Roadmap" section for planned features.

## Development Workflow

This project was built in **GitHub Codespaces** and is designed to run on a **headless Mac Mini** accessed remotely:

1. Code editing: VS Code (Codespaces/Remote SSH)
2. Version control: Git (push from Codespaces)
3. Building: Xcode on Mac Mini (via AnyDesk/SSH)
4. Testing: iOS Simulator or physical device
5. Distribution: TestFlight (via Xcode on Mac Mini)

## Ready to Ship?

**Almost!** You need to:
1. Add your OpenAI API key
2. Configure code signing with your Apple Developer team
3. Test on a real device
4. (Optional) Replace placeholder branding assets

Then you're ready to build, test, and deploy to TestFlight.
