# DrawEvolve iPad Testing Checklist

**Generated:** October 12, 2025
**Session:** Selection Tools Implementation
**Build:** Latest main branch (commit dddd5a4)

---

## üéØ Priority 1: Selection Tools (NEW - Just Implemented)

### Rectangle Selection Tool
- [ ] Tap rectangle select tool, drag to create selection
- [ ] Verify marching ants animation appears (black/white dashed border)
- [ ] Tap inside selection and drag - should move selection with semi-transparent preview
- [ ] Release - selection should commit to new position
- [ ] Switch to different tool - selection should auto-commit
- [ ] Undo - selection movement should revert
- [ ] Redo - selection movement should reapply

### Lasso Selection Tool
- [ ] Tap lasso tool, draw freeform shape around area
- [ ] Verify marching ants follow the drawn path
- [ ] Tap inside lasso selection and drag to move
- [ ] Verify point-in-polygon hit detection works (only triggers inside shape)
- [ ] Release and verify pixels committed correctly

### Selection Actions
- [ ] Create selection, tap "Delete" button - pixels should clear
- [ ] Undo delete - pixels should restore
- [ ] Create selection, tap "Cancel" - selection should clear without affecting canvas
- [ ] Create selection with rectangle, then create new selection with lasso - first should cancel

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to drag outside a selection - should NOT move it (only triggers inside)
- [ ] Create very small selection (10x10 pixels) - should still work
- [ ] Create very large selection (full canvas) - should still work
- [ ] Move selection off-canvas partially - should handle gracefully
- [ ] Create selection, draw with brush, switch back to selection - should be gone
- [ ] Multiple undo/redo cycles with selections

## üéØ Priority 4: Layers

### Layer Management
- [ ] Tap layers button (stack icon)
- [ ] Add new layer - should create "Layer 2"
- [ ] Draw on Layer 2 - stroke should appear
- [ ] Hide Layer 2 (eye icon) - drawing should disappear
- [ ] Show Layer 2 - drawing should reappear
- [ ] Delete Layer 2 (must have at least 1 layer)

### Layer Thumbnails
- [ ] Draw on layer - thumbnail should update to show preview
- [ ] Switch layers - correct layer should be selected

---

## üéØ Priority 5: Shape Tools

- [ ] Button should say "Get personalized feedback" (not "AI feedback")

### Feedback Panel
- [ ] Draw something, tap "Get Feedback" button
- [ ] Wait for response (may take 5-10 seconds)
- [ ] Floating panel should appear with feedback
- [ ] Drag panel around - should move smoothly
- [ ] Collapse panel (chevron down) - should minimize to icon

## üö® Known Issues to Document

### P0 Issues (Critical):
1. **Canvas Rotation** - NOT TESTED YET
   - [ ] Rotate iPad from portrait to landscape while drawing
   - [ ] Check if existing strokes distort (EXPECTED BUG)

2. **Zoom** - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
   - [ ] Try pinch-to-zoom gesture (will not work - not implemented)

### P1 Issues (Important):
1. **Brush Width on Release**
   - [ ] Draw stroke, note width at end
   - [ ] If last point is thicker than rest - CONFIRM BUG

2. **Landing Screen**
   - [ ] App launches directly to canvas (might feel too fast)

3. **Dark Mode Toggle**
   - [ ] No in-app toggle for dark/light mode (uses system setting)

## üîç Debug Logging to Check

If you encounter issues, check Xcode console for:

```
‚úÖ Marks successful operations
‚ùå Marks errors
üëÜ Touch input events
üé® Rendering operations
‚úÇÔ∏è Selection operations
```

### Key Debug Output:
- Texture IDs should match across operations
- Touch coordinates should be logged
- Selection rect/path creation logged
- Pixel extraction logged with dimensions

---

## üìä Performance Checks

- [ ] Drawing feels smooth (60fps) with no lag
- [ ] Selection drag is responsive (no stuttering)
- [ ] Gallery thumbnails load quickly
- [ ] Undo/redo is instant
- [ ] App doesn't crash during any operation
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable (check Xcode instruments if concerned)

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**Must Work:**
- ‚úÖ Create, save, and edit drawings
- ‚úÖ Gallery navigation works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Selection tools (rectangle, lasso, move, delete)
- ‚úÖ Basic drawing tools (brush, eraser, shapes)
- ‚úÖ Undo/redo functionality
- ‚úÖ Layers work correctly

**Known Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No zoom (P0 - not implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotation may distort (P0 - known bug)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Brush may thicken on release (P1 - minor)
