- Comment in code confirms this limitation

**Status:** Works but not as expected by users

---

## Non-Working Tools (UI Only)

### 15. Smudge
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**UI:** DrawingCanvasView.swift:166-168

**UI:** DrawingCanvasView.swift:183-185
**Expected:** Move layer or selection without selecting first
**Missing:** No layer transform, no direct movement logic

## Selection Tool Features

### Working Features
- Rectangle Select: Drag to define area
- Lasso Select: Freehand path drawing
- Blue preview strokes during drag (Jan 14 addition)
- Marching ants animation after selection
- Delete selected pixels: WORKING - FIXED Jan 20 (DrawingCanvasView.swift:319-333, 1002-1010)
  - Bug fixed: clearSelection() now comprehensively clears all selection state
  - Previously only cleared activeSelection/selectionPath
  - Now clears: selectionPixels, selectionOriginalRect, selectionOffset, previewSelection, previewLassoPath
- Move selected pixels: IMPLEMENTED (CanvasStateManager:1049-1139)
  - Extract pixels on selection
  - Drag selection to move
  - Commit moves pixels and clears original location
  - **Needs testing on physical device**
- Cancel selection: WORKING

### Fixed Issues (Jan 20, 2025)
- ✅ Delete selection bug fixed - clearSelection() now clears all selection-related state
- ✅ Selection cleanup simplified - commitSelection() now uses comprehensive clearSelection()

---

## Layer System

### Working Features
- Multiple layers with Metal textures (2048x2048)
- Layer visibility toggle
- Layer opacity control
- Layer add/delete with undo support
- Layer thumbnails (auto-generated)
- Blend modes defined (but implementation uncertain)

---

## Undo/Redo System

**Status:** FULLY WORKING
**Files:** HistoryManager.swift, CanvasStateManager.swift:786-907
**Supports:**
- Stroke operations (before/after snapshots)
- Layer add/remove
- Layer property changes
- Selection operations

**Verified:** Complete snapshot-based undo system

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority Testing
1. **Test move selection** - Code exists but untested on device
2. **Verify delete selection fix** - Fixed Jan 20, needs device testing
3. **Blur/Sharpen brush mode** - Currently global, needs localized application for brush-like feel

### Feature Completion Priority
1. **Magic Wand** - High user value for quick selections
2. **Smudge Tool** - Common artist tool, good UX addition
3. **Clone Stamp** - Professional feature for advanced users
4. **Transform Tools** - Re-enable zoom/pan/rotate (code exists)

### Low Priority
- Move Tool (selection movement already works)
- Scale Tool (less critical)
- Rotate Tool (less critical)

---

## Technical Notes

### Coordinate Scaling
All tools properly scale between:
- Screen space (touch coordinates)
- Texture space (2048x2048 Metal textures)
- Formula: `scaleFactor = textureSize / screenSize`

### Metal Rendering
- GPU-accelerated brush/eraser rendering
- Point sprite rendering for smooth strokes
- Pressure sensitivity via vertex shader uniforms
- Blend modes: Alpha blending (brush), Zero blend (eraser)

### Selection Architecture
- **Preview Phase:** Blue stroke shows selection boundary during drag
- **Active Phase:** Marching ants animation after release
- **Pixel Extraction:** UIImage extracted with alpha masking for lasso
- **Movement:** Offset tracking, commit clears original and renders at new location

---

## Files Reference

**Core Rendering:**
- `CanvasRenderer.swift` - Metal rendering engine
- `MetalCanvasView.swift` - Touch handling and coordination
- `DrawingCanvasView.swift` - SwiftUI UI and tool selection

**Tool Definitions:**
- `DrawingTool.swift` - Enum of all 22 tools with icons/names

**State Management:**
- `CanvasStateManager.swift` - Canvas state, layers, selection, undo/redo

---

## Conclusion

DrawEvolve has **12 fully working tools** (including Magic Wand as of Jan 20, 2025) providing solid core functionality for drawing and selection. The app is production-ready for TestFlight with current feature set. The **8 remaining unimplemented tools** are UI placeholders that should either be implemented or removed before public release to avoid user confusion.

The two **partially working tools** (Blur/Sharpen) need refinement to work as brush-based effects rather than global filters.

### Recent Additions (Jan 20, 2025)
- ✅ **Magic Wand** - Flood fill selection with color matching, boundary tracing, and full integration with selection system

See **TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** for detailed requirements and implementation plans for remaining tools.
