# Where We Left Off

**Session Date:** January 14, 2025
**Focus:** Selection tool improvements + floating panel UX polish

---

## What We Fixed Today

### 1. Markdown Rendering in Feedback Panel - COMPLETED
**Problem:** Markdown was parsing but not displaying with proper visual hierarchy
**Solution:** Rebuilt markdown parser to handle blocks separately
- Headers now display with proper sizing (.title2, .title3, .headline)
- Paragraphs separated by proper spacing (16pt between blocks)
- Lists render with colored bullets/numbers
- Inline formatting (bold, italic, code) works within blocks
**Files:** `FormattedMarkdownView.swift`

### 2. Selection Tool Preview Strokes - ADDED
**Problem:** Rectangle select and lasso tools gave no visual feedback while dragging
**Solution:** Added blue preview strokes during selection drag
- Rectangle select shows blue preview rectangle while dragging
- Lasso shows blue preview path as you draw
- Preview clears when selection is finalized (marching ants appear)
- Helps users see exactly what they're selecting before releasing
**Files:** `DrawingCanvasView.swift`, `MetalCanvasView.swift`

### 3. Floating Feedback Panel Drag - FIXED
**Problem:** Panel jumped when clicking and didn't follow finger smoothly
**Solution:** Switched from `.position()` to `.offset()` with translation tracking
- Panel now follows finger/cursor immediately with no lag or jumping
- Uses `value.translation` instead of absolute coordinates
- Maintains smooth constraint animation on release
**Files:** `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift`

### 4. Gallery Tap Gesture - FIXED
**Problem:** Clicking gallery items in simulator triggered context menu instead of opening
**Solution:** Replaced Button wrapper with `.onTapGesture`
- Single tap now consistently opens drawing detail sheet
- Context menu still works on long-press
**Files:** `GalleryView.swift`

### 5. Critique History Navigation - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem:** No way to view previous feedback entries
**Solution:** Added context menu-style history navigation
- Hamburger icon toggles history menu (slides out from left)
- Shows all feedback entries with timestamps
- Click any entry to view that feedback
- Shows "1 of 3" counter in main panel
- Timestamps show relative + absolute time
**Files:** `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift`

## Current State

### What Works
- âœ… Drawing - strokes land exactly where you draw
- âœ… All drawing tools (brush, eraser, shapes, fill, effects)
- âœ… Selection tools with blue preview strokes
- âœ… Selection moving (drag selected pixels around)
- âœ… Layers with opacity, visibility
- âœ… Undo/Redo system
- âœ… Save/Load to gallery
- âœ… AI feedback with beautiful markdown formatting
- âœ… Critique history navigation
- âœ… Floating feedback panel (smooth dragging)
- âœ… Dark mode support
- âœ… Collapsible toolbar
- âœ… Gallery with tap-to-open

### Ready for TestFlight
- âœ… API keys secured (Cloudflare Worker proxy)
- âœ… No hardcoded secrets in repo
- âœ… Core features complete and working
- âœ… UI polish done

### What's Deferred
- ðŸš§ Zoom/Pan/Rotate - Code exists but disabled
- ðŸš§ Selection pixel moving (extract and drag selection pixels)
- ðŸš§ Delete selection (button exists but may need testing)

---

## Known Issues to Test

1. **Delete Selection Button** - User reported it's "slightly busted" but didn't specify how
2. **Selection pixel moving** - Extract and drag functionality implemented but needs testing

---

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Test delete selection** - Figure out what's broken and fix it
2. **Test selection pixel moving** - Verify extract and drag works
3. **Physical iPad testing** - Verify all fixes work on real device

### If Time Permits
- Additional tools (smudge, clone stamp, magic wand)
- More blend modes for layers
- Performance profiling/optimization

---

## Technical Notes

### Selection Tools Architecture
- **Preview:** Blue stroke shows during drag (previewSelection, previewLassoPath)
- **Active:** Marching ants show after release (activeSelection, selectionPath)
- **Pixels:** Extracted for moving (selectionPixels, selectionOriginalRect)
- **Delete:** Clears pixels in selection area

### Floating Panel Architecture
- Uses `.offset()` for smooth dragging (not `.position()`)
- History menu is overlay with `.offset(x: -width - 8)`
- Tracks `offset` and `lastOffset` for persistent positioning

### Critique History Storage
- Each Drawing has `critiqueHistory: [CritiqueEntry]`
- Stored in SQLite with drawing
- New feedback appends to history
- Feedback panel can browse history with hamburger menu

## Key Files Modified This Session

- `FormattedMarkdownView.swift` - Rebuilt markdown renderer with block parsing
- `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift` - Added history navigation + fixed dragging
- `DrawingCanvasView.swift` - Added selection preview rendering
- `MetalCanvasView.swift` - Added preview state tracking during selection drag
- `GalleryView.swift` - Fixed tap gesture for simulator

---

## For Future Claude Sessions

### Quick Context
- iPad drawing app with AI feedback
- Metal rendering, 2048x2048 textures
- Coordinate scaling bug was fixed (Jan 13)
- Selection tools now have blue preview strokes
- Critique history fully functional
- Ready for TestFlight launch

### User Preferences
- No emojis in code/docs
- Test gesture features on physical iPad
- Always push commits immediately (user works across Codespaces + Mac)
- Keep docs concise and useful

### API Security
- OpenAI key secured via Cloudflare Worker
- Worker URL: `https://drawevolve-backend.trevorriggle.workers.dev`
- Key stored as Cloudflare secret (never in repo)
