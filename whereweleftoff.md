# Where We Left Off

**Session Date:** January 13, 2025
**Focus:** Fixed critical stroke offset bug + added markdown rendering

---

## What We Fixed

### CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED: Brush strokes jumping 70-100px left on release

**Root Cause:**
`CanvasRenderer.swift` line 220 was using a uniform scale based on max dimension:
```swift
let uniformScale = Float(texture.width) / Float(max(screenSize.width, screenSize.height))
```

This caused incorrect coordinate mapping on non-square screens/textures.

**The Fix:**
Changed to separate X/Y scaling:
```swift
let scaleX = Float(texture.width) / Float(screenSize.width)
let scaleY = Float(texture.height) / Float(screenSize.height)
```

**File:** `/workspaces/DrawEvolve/DrawEvolve/DrawEvolve/Services/CanvasRenderer.swift` lines 216-228

**Result:** Strokes now render exactly where you draw them. No more offset!

---

## What We Added

1. **Markdown rendering in feedback panel** - Feedback now displays with proper formatting (bold, bullets, headers, etc.)
2. **Updated documentation** - Cleaned up PROJECT_STATUS.md, whereweleftoff.md, and TESTING-CHECKLIST.md

---

## What We Learned

### Don't Overthink Coordinate Systems
- We spent time trying to fix the bug by changing view.bounds.size to drawable.texture.size
- That made it WORSE (strokes jumped even further)
- The real issue was in the renderer's scaling calculation all along
- **Lesson:** Check the math in the rendering pipeline, not just the input coordinates

### Zoom/Pan is Deferred
- The zoom/pan transformation code exists but is currently unused
- It was interfering with drawing (causing the coordinate bugs we were chasing)
- **Decision:** Leave it disabled until we can test properly on physical iPad
- The gesture recognizers are there, we just need to properly implement the coordinate transforms

---

## Current State

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Drawing - strokes land exactly where you draw (BUG FIXED!)
- ‚úÖ All drawing tools (brush, eraser, shapes, fill, effects)
- ‚úÖ Selection tools (rectangle, lasso with marching ants)
- ‚úÖ Layers with opacity, visibility
- ‚úÖ Undo/Redo system
- ‚úÖ Save/Load to gallery
- ‚úÖ AI feedback with markdown rendering
- ‚úÖ Dark mode support
- ‚úÖ Collapsible toolbar

### What's Untested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critique history - Models, storage, and UI are all implemented but need end-to-end verification

### What's Deferred
- üöß Zoom/Pan/Rotate - Code exists but disabled due to coordinate system conflicts
- üöß Need to test on physical iPad before re-enabling

---

## Next Session TODO

### Must Test on Physical iPad
1. **Verify the stroke fix works perfectly** - This was a critical bug, need to confirm it's truly fixed
2. **Test critique history** - Get feedback multiple times, verify history view displays correctly
3. **Try zoom/pan implementation** - With device in hand, properly implement gesture transforms

### If User Requests New Features
- Additional tools (smudge, clone stamp, magic wand)
- More blend modes for layers
- Performance profiling/optimization

---

## Important Technical Notes

### Coordinate System Architecture
Current implementation is SIMPLE and WORKING:
- Touch coordinates ‚Üí scale directly to texture space
- No transformations, no document space, no view transforms
- This simplicity is why the fix worked

If implementing zoom/pan later:
- Don't transform touch coordinates in `MetalCanvasView`
- Apply transforms in the renderer during display only
- Keep stroke storage in untransformed texture space

### Key Files Modified Today
- `CanvasRenderer.swift` line 218-220 (THE FIX)
- `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift` (added markdown rendering - NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (updated)
- `whereweleftoff.md` (this file)
- `TESTING-CHECKLIST.md` (updated)

---

## Git Status
- Branch: `main`
- Recent commits: Coordinate scaling fix, documentation updates
- **Ready to test on physical iPad**

---

## For Future Claude Sessions

### Quick Context
- This is an iPad drawing app with AI feedback
- Metal-based rendering with 2048x2048 textures
- Just fixed a major coordinate scaling bug
- Zoom/pan exists but is disabled - don't re-enable without testing on device

### Files You'll Need
- `MetalCanvasView.swift` - Touch handling
- `CanvasRenderer.swift` - Metal rendering (line 218-220 is the critical fix)
- `DrawingCanvasView.swift` - Main UI
- `CanvasStateManager.swift` - State (has zoom/pan code that's unused)

### User Preferences
- No emojis in code/docs
- Test gesture features on physical iPad before implementing
- Keep documentation concise and useful
