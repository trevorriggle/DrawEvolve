# Where We Left Off - DrawEvolve iPad Development

**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025
**Session Focus:** Selection Tools Implementation

---

## üéØ What We Completed Today

### ‚úÖ Selection Tools (P2) - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Implemented complete selection tools functionality with professional-grade features:

1. **Marching Ants UI**
   - Animated dual-color dashed border (black/white alternating)
   - Works for both rectangle and lasso selections
   - Smooth 1-second animation loop
   - Files: `DrawingCanvasView.swift:1020-1106`

2. **Pixel Extraction System** (362 lines)
   - Rectangle selection: Direct pixel extraction with BGRA format handling
   - Lasso selection: Point-in-polygon masking for irregular shapes
   - Proper alpha channel preservation for transparent areas
   - Files: `CanvasRenderer.swift:1107-1464`
   - Methods: `extractPixels(from:)`, `extractPixels(fromPath:)`, `renderImage(_:at:to:)`

3. **Touch-Drag Movement**
   - Point-in-selection hit testing (rectangle contains + ray-casting for polygons)
   - Real-time offset tracking during drag
   - Semi-transparent preview (80% opacity) showing moved selection
   - Smooth touch response with proper coordinate handling
   - Files: `MetalCanvasView.swift` (132 lines added)

4. **Selection Management**
   - Auto-commit on tool change (ensures pixels finalized before switching)
   - Delete selected pixels with undo support
   - Cancel selection
   - Proper history tracking for all operations
   - Files: `DrawingCanvasView.swift:488-493` (tool change handler)

**Commits:**
- `ce39e94` - Add marching ants UI and selection infrastructure
- `d2e006b` - Add debug logging for brush rendering
- `5b7610c` - Implement selection pixel movement with touch-drag
- `9b51ed1` - Update iPad audit with completion status

## üî¥ Critical Issues Remaining

### P0 Issues (2 remaining - ~10 hours):

1. **Canvas rotation distorts drawing** üî¥ NOT STARTED
   - Est. hours: 5-6
   - Issue: Strokes stored in screen coordinates, distort when device rotates
   - Solution: Implement document-space coordinates with view transform matrix
   - Complexity: HIGH - requires architectural refactor of coordinate system
   - Files to modify: `BrushStroke.swift`, `CanvasRenderer.swift`, `MetalCanvasView.swift`
   - Note: This is a foundational change that touches the entire rendering pipeline

2. **No zoom** üî¥ NOT STARTED
   - Est. hours: 4-5
   - Issue: No pinch-to-zoom support
   - Solution: Add pinch gesture recognition and scale transform
   - Complexity: MEDIUM - depends on coordinate system refactor
   - Files to modify: `MetalCanvasView.swift`, `CanvasStateManager.swift`
   - Note: Should be implemented after rotation fix for consistency

### P1 Issues (3 remaining - ~7-8 hours):

1. **Landing screen loads too fast** üü° NOT STARTED
   - Est. hours: 2
   - Low complexity, quick win

2. **Brush thickens on release** üü° NOT STARTED
   - Est. hours: 3
   - Debug logging already added
   - Issue in touch pipeline, needs investigation

3. **Dark mode toggle + logo variants** üü° NOT STARTED
   - Est. hours: 2-3
   - Asset swap + system preference integration

## üé® Current Architecture Notes

### Coordinate System (IMPORTANT FOR P0 WORK):

**Current Implementation:**
- Strokes store `CGPoint` directly in screen coordinates
- `renderStroke()` converts screen ‚Üí texture using `screenSize` parameter
- Works fine until device rotates (screen size changes, old strokes distort)

**Key Files:**
- `DrawingTool.swift:112-116` - `BrushStroke.StrokePoint` struct
- `CanvasRenderer.swift:160` - `renderStroke()` method
- `MetalCanvasView.swift:478-565` - Touch handling with screen coordinates

**Proposed Fix (for future session):**
1. Add `ViewTransform` struct to track zoom/pan/rotation
2. Store strokes in normalized document space (0-1 range)
3. Apply transform during rendering and touch input
4. Handle both device rotation and user rotation gestures

**Risk Assessment:**
- HIGH complexity - touches entire rendering pipeline
- Requires careful testing to avoid breaking existing functionality
- May need migration path for existing drawings
- Estimated 10 hours for proper implementation

### Selection System Architecture:

**Components:**
- `CanvasStateManager` - Tracks active selection, offset, extracted pixels
- `MetalCanvasView.Coordinator` - Touch handling, drag detection
- `DrawingCanvasView` - Marching ants overlay, visual preview
- `CanvasRenderer` - CPU-based pixel extraction/rendering

**How It Works:**
1. User creates selection ‚Üí `extractSelectionPixels()` called
2. Pixels stored in `selectionPixels: UIImage?`
3. User drags inside selection ‚Üí `selectionOffset` updated in real-time
4. SwiftUI overlay shows preview at `originalRect + offset`
5. Release or tool change ‚Üí `commitSelection()` finalizes to texture

## üõ† Development Recommendations

### For Next Session - Prioritization Options:

**Option A: Tackle P0 Issues (Ambitious)**
- Pros: Fixes foundational issues, enables true device rotation support
- Cons: High complexity, 10 hours estimated, risk of introducing bugs
- Recommendation: Only if you have dedicated time and can test thoroughly

**Option B: Quick Wins First (Pragmatic)**
1. Lock orientation to landscape (Info.plist - 5 minutes)
2. Fix brush width issue (P1 - 3 hours)
3. Add dark mode toggle (P1 - 2-3 hours)
4. Add landing screen (P1 - 2 hours)
- Pros: Lower risk, immediate visible improvements, builds momentum
- Cons: Defers foundational fixes

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
1. Implement zoom-only (without full rotation support) - 4 hours
2. Lock device orientation temporarily
3. Tackle P1 quick wins
4. Plan coordinate refactor for dedicated session

### Technical Debt to Address:
- [ ] Coordinate system refactor (P0 dependency)
- [ ] Brush width stabilization on touchesEnded (P1)
- [ ] Consider migration strategy for existing drawings

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Testing Checklist for Coordinate System Work:
- [ ] Test with existing drawings (ensure no distortion)
- [ ] Test zoom in/out at various levels
- [ ] Test device rotation while drawing
- [ ] Test selection tools with zoom/rotation active
- [ ] Test undo/redo with transformed coordinates
- [ ] Performance test with large canvases

### Known Issues to Monitor:
- Debug logging added for brush rendering (commit d2e006b)
- Brush width changes on touchesEnded still needs investigation
- Metal texture size fixed (zoom is view-level only)

## üí° Key Learnings from This Session

1. **Selection Tools Complexity**: CPU-based pixel extraction was the right choice over GPU compute shaders - simpler, more reliable, easier to debug.

2. **Point-in-Polygon**: Ray-casting algorithm works perfectly for lasso hit testing, performs well even with complex paths.

3. **SwiftUI Overlay Performance**: Using SwiftUI Image overlay for selection preview is smooth enough at 60fps, no need for Metal rendering.

4. **Coordinate System Matters**: The P0 rotation issue is a good example of why storing coordinates in screen space was a shortcut that now needs proper refactoring.

5. **Incremental Progress**: Completing P2 selection tools (even though P0s remain) provides immediate user value and demonstrates progress.

---

**Status:** Selection tools complete and functional. Ready to tackle P0 coordinate system work or pivot to P1 quick wins based on priority.

**Next Decision Point:** Choose between foundational refactor (P0) or quick wins (P1) based on available time and risk tolerance.
