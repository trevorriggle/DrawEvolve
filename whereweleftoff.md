# Where We Left Off

**Session Date:** January 20, 2025
**Focus:** Apple Pencil input fix + feedback panel UX + selection deletion bug fix

---

## What We Fixed Today

### 1. Apple Pencil Not Working - FIXED
**Problem:** Apple Pencil stopped responding to touch input
**Root Cause:** SwiftUI overlays were blocking hit testing even when empty
**Solution:** Added `Color.clear.allowsHitTesting(false)` to empty overlay branches
- Fixed three overlays in ContentView: beta transparency, onboarding, and prompt input
- Touch events now properly pass through to canvas when overlays not visible
**Files:** `ContentView.swift` (lines 26-54)

### 2. Feedback Panel Spawning Offscreen - FIXED
**Problem:** Floating feedback panel could spawn completely offscreen, making it inaccessible
**Solution:** Rewrote positioning logic and added reset button
- Switched from offset-based to absolute `.position()` coordinates
- Improved initial positioning calculation to stay within safe screen bounds
- Added reset position button (counterclockwise arrow icon) to restore default position
- Panel now properly constrains to screen edges when dragged
**Files:** `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift` (lines 15-16, 54-58, 226-291)

### 3. Collapsed Feedback Icon Not Draggable - FIXED
**Problem:** Collapsed feedback icon wasn't animating smoothly during drag
**Root Cause:** Button wrapper was capturing all touch events before drag gesture
**Solution:** Replaced Button with ZStack + `.onTapGesture`
- Tap gesture now coexists with drag gesture
- Icon follows finger smoothly during drag
- Tap to expand still works
**Files:** `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift` (lines 177-194)

### 4. AI Feedback Button Added to Toolbar - NEW FEATURE
**Problem:** No way to reopen feedback panel after closing it
**Solution:** Added sparkles icon button to toolbar
- Opens existing feedback if available
- Requests new feedback if none exists
- Disabled when canvas is empty
- Provides easy access to AI feedback
**Files:** `DrawingCanvasView.swift` (lines 244-254)

### 5. Paint Bucket Icon Updated - FIXED
**Problem:** Paint bucket was using wrong icon ("paintpalette.fill")
**Solution:** Changed to "drop.fill" icon
**Files:** `DrawingTool.swift` (line 45)

### 6. Critique History Order Reversed - FIXED
**Problem:** History showed oldest critique first, newest last
**Solution:** Reversed enumeration to show newest first
- Most recent critique now appears at top of history menu
- Older critiques appear below when scrolling
**Files:** `FloatingFeedbackPanel.swift` (line 128)

### 7. Delete Selection Bug - FIXED
**Problem:** Delete selection was "slightly busted" - selection pixels weren't being cleared properly
**Root Cause:** `clearSelection()` only cleared `activeSelection` and `selectionPath` but not `selectionPixels`, `selectionOriginalRect`, or `selectionOffset`
**Solution:** Updated `clearSelection()` to clear ALL selection-related state
- Now clears: activeSelection, selectionPath, selectionPixels, selectionOriginalRect, selectionOffset, previewSelection, previewLassoPath
- Simplified `commitSelection()` to use comprehensive `clearSelection()` function
- Delete selection now properly removes all traces of selection
**Files:** `DrawingCanvasView.swift` (lines 1002-1010, 1174-1176)

### 8. Magic Wand Selection Tool - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem:** Magic wand tool was UI-only placeholder with no functionality
**Solution:** Fully implemented magic wand selection with flood fill algorithm
- Tap to select contiguous pixels of similar color
- Configurable color tolerance (0.0 = exact match, 1.0 = any color)
- Flood fill algorithm with 100,000 pixel safety limit
- Boundary tracing to create selection path
- Full integration with selection system (move, delete, extract pixels)
- Converts texture coordinates to screen coordinates for marching ants display
**Files:** `MetalCanvasView.swift` (lines 530-560, 1178-1336)

### 9. Tool Implementation Roadmap - CREATED
**Problem:** Need clear plan for implementing remaining 8 tools
**Solution:** Created comprehensive roadmap document
- Detailed requirements for each unimplemented tool
- Implementation approach for each tool
- Estimated effort and complexity ratings
- Priority ranking (Quick Wins â†’ High Value â†’ Lower Priority)
- Technical notes on Metal shader requirements
- Testing checklist for future implementations
**Files:** `TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (new file)

## Current State

### What Works
- âœ… Drawing - strokes land exactly where you draw
- âœ… Apple Pencil input (overlay hit testing fixed)
- âœ… All drawing tools (brush, eraser, shapes, fill, effects)
- âœ… Selection tools:
  - Rectangle select with blue preview
  - Lasso select with blue preview
  - Magic Wand select (NEW - flood fill with color matching)
- âœ… Delete selection (bug fixed - now clears all selection state)
- âœ… Selection moving (drag selected pixels around)
- âœ… Layers with opacity, visibility
- âœ… Undo/Redo system
- âœ… Save/Load to gallery
- âœ… AI feedback with beautiful markdown formatting
- âœ… Critique history navigation (newest first)
- âœ… Floating feedback panel (smooth dragging, reset position button)
- âœ… AI feedback toolbar button (reopen panel after closing)
- âœ… Dark mode support
- âœ… Collapsible toolbar
- âœ… Gallery with tap-to-open

### Ready for TestFlight
- âœ… API keys secured (Cloudflare Worker proxy)
- âœ… No hardcoded secrets in repo
- âœ… Core features complete and working
- âœ… UI polish done
- âœ… Critical bugs fixed (Apple Pencil, selection deletion)

### What's Deferred
- ðŸš§ Zoom/Pan/Rotate - Code exists but disabled
- ðŸš§ Selection pixel moving (extract and drag selection pixels) - needs testing
- ðŸš§ Additional tools (Smudge, Clone Stamp, Move, Rotate, Scale) - see TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
- ðŸš§ Brush-mode Blur/Sharpen - currently apply globally instead of locally

---

## Known Issues to Test

1. **Selection pixel moving** - Extract and drag functionality implemented but needs testing

---

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Test selection pixel moving** - Verify extract and drag works
2. **Physical iPad testing** - Verify all fixes work on real device

### If Time Permits
- Additional tools (smudge, clone stamp, magic wand)
- More blend modes for layers
- Performance profiling/optimization

---

## Technical Notes

### Selection Tools Architecture
- **Preview:** Blue stroke shows during drag (previewSelection, previewLassoPath)
- **Active:** Marching ants show after release (activeSelection, selectionPath)
- **Pixels:** Extracted for moving (selectionPixels, selectionOriginalRect)
- **Delete:** Clears pixels in selection area

### Floating Panel Architecture
- Uses `.position()` with `dragOffset` for smooth dragging
- History menu is overlay with `.offset(x: -width - 8)`
- Tracks `position` (absolute) and `dragOffset` (temporary during drag)
- Reset button restores default top-right position

### Critique History Storage
- Each Drawing has `critiqueHistory: [CritiqueEntry]`
- Stored in SQLite with drawing
- New feedback appends to history
- Feedback panel can browse history with hamburger menu
